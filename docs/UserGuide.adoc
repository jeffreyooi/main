== Introduction

Flashbook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their to-do for university. Flashbook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the to-do list faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Flash Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Display all existing tasks on the display.
* **`add`**`n this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one` : adds a task named `Problem_5.12` to the FlashBook and set the deadline of the task to due on `10/08/18`.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in square brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]`, `TaskParameters` and `tag` are parameters which can be used as `changeto urgent with deadline on 110918`.
* Words in square brackets are optional. e.g. `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]` can be used as `changeto with deadline on 110918` or `changeto urgent`

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a new task: `add`

Add a new task named [Task Name] with parameters described in [Task Parameters] to the module [Module Name]. +
Format: `in [Module Name] add [Tag] [Task Name] with [Task Parameters]:[Description]`

[NOTE]
If Module Name is “this” or “&”, the new task will be added as a subtask of the selected task

.Possible tags are:
* urgent / u
* high / h
* normal / n (default)
* low / l
* done / d (this task will not show up in the find command unless specified)

.Possible task parameters:

* Deadline: `deadline on DDMMYY`, or the shorthand `dlDDMMYY`
* Location: `@[Location Name]`

Examples:

* `in ST2131 add urgent Homework_1 with deadline on 170918 @S17:12 pages of statistics.` : In Module ST2131, add task Homework_1 with deadline on `17/09/18`, with task description of `12 pages of statistics` and location of task is at `S17`.
* `#ST2131 a u Homework_1 dl170918 @S17:12 pages of statistics.`
* `in this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one`
* `#& a h Problem_5.12 dl100918: the most difficult one`

[NOTE]
[Task Name] must be a string without spaces and is not a restricted keyword.

=== Editing a task : `changeto`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using `select` command. +
****
Replace the selected tasks’ parameters with those described in this command (undescribed parameters will not be changed) +

Format: `changeto [Tag] with [TaskParameters]:[TaskDescription]`, or the shorthand `c [Tag] w [Taskparameters]:[TaskDescription]`

Examples:

* `changeto urgent with deadline on 150918: only ten pages is needed` +
Edits task selected to be of `urgent` tag and deadline on `15/09/18`, with task description of `only ten pages is needed`.
* `ct u w dl120918` +
Edit task selected tagging it with `urgent` and set its deadline to `12/09/18`
* `changeto with deadline on 110918: deadline extended` +
Edit task selected deadline to `11/09/18`

=== Deleting a task: `delete/del`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using select command
****
Remove the selected task. +
Format: `delete`, or the shorthand `del`


=== Managing the module list: modules

Management of modules in FlashBook. Capabilities of FlashBook module system includes:

- Create a module: `modules create [Module Name]`, or `+\#[Module Name]`
- Delete a module: `modules delete [Module Name]`, or `~#[Module Name]`
- List modules: `modules`, or `#`
- List tasks in the module: `modules [Module Name]`, or `#[Module Name]`
- Delete all modules: `modules delete \*` or `~*`

Examples:

* modules create CS2103T
* modules delete CS2101
* +#ST2334
* ~#CS2040
* #CS2040
* #
* ~*

`[Module Name] must be an alphanumeric string without spaces.`

=== Find a task: `find / findwhere`

Finds tasks and display it on the screen. +
Format: `in [Module List] findwhere [TaskParameters] , or in [Module List] find [Name]` +
Shorthand format: `#[Module List] fw [TaskParameters], or #[Module List] f [Name]`

* The first version finds tasks with parameters that match [TaskParameters], while the second version finds tasks with name that match [Name].
* Possible [TaskParameters] are: +
.  Deadline: “Deadline [on/after/before] DDMMYY” or “dl[=/>/<]DDMMYY”
.  Tag: “tag=[Tag]” or “t=[Tag]”
.  Location: “location=[LocationName]” or “@=[LocationName]”
* [Module List] can be replaced with “any” or “*” to select all modules

Examples:

* `in MA2101 findwhere tag=high location=S17 deadline before 300918`
* `in CS2103T, CS2101 find LO5.7`
* `in any findwhere tag=urgent`
* `#CS2030,CS2040 fw @=COM1`
* `#* find lab3`

The “then” keyword:

If “then [Command]”  is inserted after find, the [Command] will be applied to all results of the find command.
[Command] can be replaced with either changeto, delete, or markdone.

Thus it is possible to run commands like
“in CS2101 findwhere then delete” to delete every task under CS2101

=== Sort the list: `sort`

Sorts the current displayed list based on the given property. +
Format: `sort [TODO]` +


=== Selecting a task : `select`

****
Pre-condition: user already list all available tasks using  find/findwhere command
Select and displays a task from the list obtained using find
****

Format: `“select [index]” or “s[index]” when [index] is a positive integer (starts from 1)`

****
* This also display all subtasks of the selected task.
  If a task is already on display, this command instead select a subtask from the displayed tasks’ list of subtasks.
****


=== Going back to the parent task : `back / b`

If the selected task is a subtask, go back to the parent task of this subtask.

=== Listing all tasks : `list`

Display all existing tasks on the display.

=== Marking the selected task as done: `markdone / md`

*Pre-condition:* Task is already selected using select command

Change the tag the selected task to “done”.
To reverse this, find and select the task then use the changeto command

=== Import Persons : `import`

User is able to import FlashBook or any AddressBook-level4. +

****
FlashBook is backward compatible to AddressBook-level4. +

This means that users of AddressBook-level4 are able to upgrade to use FlashBook by just importing their AddressBook-level4 storage file. +
****
Format: `import <relative filepath>`

Example:
`import /f flashBookBackUp.xml` : import `flashBookBackUp.xml` into FlashBook.
`import /f addressBookBackUp.xml` : import `addressBookBackUp.xml` into FlashBook even if the imported file is Addressbook and not FlashBook.

=== Export Persons : `export`

User is able to export FlashBook as backup elsewhere. +
Format: +
`export \f <filepath>`

Example:

`export \f backup.xml` : Export FlashBook as `backup.xml`.

=== Autocomplete

To assist user to speed up typing of command, user can <TAB> to autocomplete the command.

=== Saving the data

Flashbook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
