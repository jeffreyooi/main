== PROJECT: MeetingBook

MeetingBook is a desktop scheduler application targeted at university students involved in multiple Co-Curricular Activities and Project-Based modules. The application is a modified contact book with features to group contacts and assign meetings to such groups. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students from National University of Singapore's School of Computing. It is forked from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4] written by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU].
